## Promotions

{% if promotions_per_line_item == "many" %}
Multiple promotions can apply to a single line item.
{% if stackable_promotions %}
These promotions can stack, meaning their discounts are cumulative.
{% else %}
When multiple promotions apply, only one discount is actually used (the selection mechanism is not always transparent).
{% endif %}
{% else %}
Each line item can have at most one promotion applied.
{% endif %}

{% if basket_level_promotions %}
Some promotions apply at the basket level rather than to individual line items. These discounts are based on the overall transaction (e.g., "10% off orders over $100") rather than specific products.
{% endif %}

{% if post_transaction_promotions %}
Promotions can be applied after a transaction has been completed. This may result in adjustment events that modify the effective price of historical transactions.
