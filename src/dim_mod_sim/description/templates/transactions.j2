## Transaction Recording

{{ shop_name }} {{ grain_phrase }}.

{{ multiple_payments_phrase }}. Each payment is recorded with its method and amount.

{% if voids_enabled %}
{{ voids_phrase }}. Void events reference the original transaction but are recorded as separate events with their own timestamps.
{% else %}
{{ voids_phrase }}.
{% endif %}

{% if manual_overrides %}
Managers may apply manual price overrides that differ from both the listed price and any applicable promotions. Override amounts are recorded, but the original pre-override price context may not always be preserved.
